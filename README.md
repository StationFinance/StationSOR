# StationSOR

redone from scratch, previous team member didn't push updates so old version was incomplete.
needs to be split across multiple files for readability, will do this week.

The Smart Order Router is our solution to the number one problem in defi derivatives today: Lack of Liquidity for institutional investors.
Our solution is to use our existing aggregator along with smart order routing to create a bundle of options across multiple platform to fill large orders without putting unncessary strain on the liquidity of each individual platform. I have built in a dataset for your convenience, and added print outs to the terminal to display results. To run, simply clone this repo then do:

```cd StationSOR```
```cd src```
```g++ main.cpp```
```./a.out```
